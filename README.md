## Requirements ##

üß∏üí¨ ```Django``` : Django library, ```Pillow``` : Python image library, ```jinja2``` : Document template library, ```gunicorn```: WSGI HTTP Server, ```contextvars``` : Task asynchronous context variables, ```typing-extensions``` : Python runtime typing extension,
```aiohttp``` : Python HTTP request API, ```click``` : Python CLI interfaces, ```wheel``` : PEP Python Enhancement Proposals, and ```multidict``` : Python dictionary key-pairs library. </br>
üêëüí¨ ‚û∞ WSGI **standard interface between web applications written in Python and Webservers** is required for Python application programs working with web-server application development by working as a background process and communication for Pythong working language with the pre-complied and complied library. You can compare it with ASP.net web application development that you may be running by ```C#.net``` and ```VB.net``` codes files or you can comply with local library loading with a web application running or target library registration as in .net registration process. As recommendations when there is a problem with the web application server and there is an error message about the WSGI application re-do verify that your ```requirements are all registered```. The configuration working ```directory path``` and configuration ```version are correct```. </br>
üß∏üí¨ ```python-3.8.13``` : run time. </br>

```
Django==3.1.3
Pillow==10.0.0
jinja2==3.0
gunicorn==20.1.0
contextvars
typing-extensions==4.1.1
aiohttp==3.8.3
click==8.0.4
wheel==0.41.1
multidict==4.5
```

## WSGI.py ##

üêëüí¨ ‚û∞ Similar to application setting or program.cs, where the application initializes and loads the required settings and modules. In the past, if we needed to create multiple applications, such as clients and servers, from a web application server, we could call from the application program.cs, which is similar to this method where WSGI called the registered module and initialized the value. Class name modification here will affect the entire project. </br>

```
"""
WSGI config for myproject project.

It exposes the WSGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.
